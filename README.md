### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Jan Carlos

I'm a web developer with a passion for solving problems and building efficient solutions. For the past two years, I've been working on a university project using **React**, **TypeScript**, **Node.js**, **Sequelize**, **Express**, and **Redux**â€”technologies I have hands-on experience with and continue to refine.

I'm always eager to collaborate on new challenges and improve my skills through real-world projects.

ðŸ’¡ Let's build something great together!
